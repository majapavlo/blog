<p>Predicting a customer’s lifetime value (LTV) can be quite a challenging task. Wang, Liu and Miao propose using <a href="https://research.google/pubs/pub48791/">a neural network with a mixture loss</a> to handle the intricacies of churn and lifetime value modelling of new customers.</p>
<p>In this blogpost we’ll take a look at their proposed solution and go through the reasoning behind their ideas. The first section briefly summarises the importance and challenges of lifetime value modelling. It also looks at how Wang, Liu and Miao tackle these problems and quickly runs through the results of their paper. The second section then takes a deeper look at their chosen architecture, specifically the output layer. Lastly, the final section goes through the proposed loss function in more detail.</p>
<p>This post is not intended to be an in-depth mathematical explanation; but rather, is meant to provide a high-level, more approachable explanation of the paper.</p>

</h2>
<p>Why are lifetime value and churn important? Having accurate insights into customers’ future purchase behaviour can support a variety of operational and strategic business activities. For example, it can help companies with customer retention by segmenting customers according to their LTV, and targeting specific customer segments with different offers and loyalty schemes, resulting in more efficient resource spending.</p>
<p>Figure 1 shows a typical skewed LTV distribution. The large count at LTV=0 shows the huge proportion of customers who have churned (they bought a product once and then never returned). To visualise the returning customers a bit better the x-axis is displayed as the logarithm of (LTV+1). This shows that the range between returning customers’ lifetime spend varies considerably. A small proportion of high spenders can sometimes account for a large amount of business revenue. This distribution with a large proportion of one-time spenders and a few rather huge spenders poses a challenge to the traditional mean-squared-error approach. You will see this in more detail in the section that dives into their loss function below.</p>
<p><img src="/blog/images/copied_from_nb/2022-01-02-ltv/fig1.PNG" alt="" title="Figure 1"></p>
<p>Commonly, LTV and churn modelling is done separately (figure 2, left). Wang, Liu and Miao’s approach, however, allows them to tackle Churn and LTV prediction simultaneously (figure 2, right).</p>
<p>Instead of looking at the LTV and Churn distributions separately, they propose using “a mixture of zero-point mass and a lognormal distribution”, calling it the zero-inflated lognormal distribution (ZILN). They then derive a mixture loss by taking the negative log-likelihood of that ZILN distribution and then use it to train their neural network on both tasks simultaneously. Too much information? Don’t worry about it. We will look at what loss functions are and how the ZILN works in more detail below. What you should take away for now is that you can use one model to predict the two tasks: Churn and LTV.</p>
<p>Wang, Liu and Miao measure the performance of their approach on the two subtasks. While the Churn prediction achieves a comparable performance with a classical binary classification loss, their LTV prediction task outperforms the traditional mean-squared-error (MSE) approach on three different evaluation metrics. We won’t dissect their evaluation metrics in this post, but you can take a look at their paper if you’d like to understand their results more.</p>

</h2>
<p>As mentioned above Wang, Liu and Miao use a neural network for their model. They opt for a simple feed-forward neural network with 64 units on the first hidden layer and 32 on the second. See the figure 3 below. These hidden units use the ReLu activation function. Numerical inputs are fed in directly, while categorical inputs are encoded as embeddings. We will focus on the output layer as these units are interesting to the loss function that we will discuss below.</p>
<p><img src="/blog/images/copied_from_nb/2022-01-02-ltv/fig2.PNG" alt="" title="Figure 2"></p>
<p>The output layer has one unit <strong>p</strong> to predict the probability of someone having churned or not. The activation function used to represent that probability is a sigmoid function. This function works well for outputting probabilities as its range of output values is between 0 and 1. A typical threshold is 0.5. A prediction that is below 0.5 will be a customer who’s still alive, while those with a prediction above 0.5 will be predicted as churned. See figure 4 below.</p>
<p><img src="/blog/images/copied_from_nb/2022-01-02-ltv/fig3.PNG" alt="" title="Figure 3"></p>
<p>LTV on the other hand needs two units. One unit to predict a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Location_parameter"><strong>location parameter μ</strong></a> and another unit to predict the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scale_parameter"><strong>scale parameter σ</strong></a>. We then use these two parameters to define a full prediction distribution, which in turn provides us with an uncertainty measure connected to our prediction (the uncertainty can be estimated by using the quantiles of our predicted distribution). These two outputs μ and σ <strong>should not be mistaken with the more familiar mean and standard</strong> deviation from a normal distribution.</p>
<p>The μ unit has no constraints in terms of range or sign. Thus, Wang, Liu and Miao opted to use an identity function for μ. This means it simply outputs the predicted value of the neural networks μ unit without running it through an activation function.</p>
<p>The scale parameter σ should only be able to return positive outputs. A common function like the exponential can solve this positivity constraint, but due to its steep growth can easily result in <a href="https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2021/06/the-challenge-of-vanishing-exploding-gradients-in-deep-neural-networks/">exploding gradients</a>. Wang, Liu and Miao opted for a softplus activation function which doesn’t grow as steeply as the exponential function. However, the softplus alone didn’t seem enough to avoid this instability when training their model so they also applied <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/what-is-gradient-clipping-b8e815cdfb48">gradient clipping</a>.</p>
<p><img src="/blog/images/copied_from_nb/2022-01-02-ltv/fig4.PNG" alt="" title="Figure 4"></p>
<p>The output layer then ends up looking like figure 6 below. <strong>Churn</strong> just needs one probability value <strong>p</strong>, whereas <strong>LTV</strong> has both <strong>μ and σ</strong>. By learning to represent multiple tasks (both Churn and LTV) using one model, the middle layers of this network learn to generalise better on each subtask. If you want to understand more about this, have a read on multi-task learning <a href="https://ruder.io/multi-task/">here</a>.</p>

<p>To train this network we minimise the error between the neural network’s predictions and the actual target value from the data. In our example this means we compare our predicted churn probability to the actual churn value. This performance measure is called the loss.</p>
<p>Depending on what you are trying to achieve, you use a different loss function that you optimise your neural network against. Given that the architecture above combines two tasks we will need a loss function that is tailored to each subtask.</p>
<p>Two common loss functions are Binary Cross Entropy (BCE) loss and Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss. BCE is used for binary classification tasks where you are trying to predict if something is true or false; meaning there are only two states. In our case that would be whether someone has churned or not. Then there is MSE which is a commonly used loss for regression problems where you are trying to predict a continuous value such as a salary, stocks or in our case LTV.</p>

</h3>
<p>For the churn task of the neural network Wang, Liu and Miao use the BCE loss:</p>
<p>
$$BCE  Loss = -\frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} -(y_i*log(p_i) + (1-y_i) * log(1-p_i))$$

        yᵢ is the true target value (1 for churn and 0 for no churn), pᵢ is the predicted probability of yᵢ =churn while (1-pᵢ) is the exact opposite (no churn)</p>
<p>The aim in our case is to correctly classify churn (class 1) and no churn (class 0). We need a way to handle both classes in one function and put a higher penalty on wrong predictions. This is achieved by activating only one part of the loss function, while keeping the other part deactivated. Giving wrong predictions a much higher error is achieved by using the logarithm. Let’s look at an example to clarify this.</p>
<p>To keep it simple, we will just look at one observation where we have the true observation belonging to class 1 (churn, y₁=1), this removes the summation, and we are left with:</p>
<p>
$$error_1 = -(y_i*log(p_i) + (1-y_i) * log(1-p_i))$$
</p>
<p>Now let’s say our model predicts this observation to be churn with a probability of 0.95 (p₁=0.95). That means that we get the following error for our observation:</p>
<p>
$$error_1 = -(1*log(0.95) + (1-1) * log(1-0.95))$$


$$        = -(1*log(0.95) + 0 * log(0.05))$$


$$        = -(1*log(0.95))$$


$$        \approx 0.051 $$
</p>
<p>This shows that only the first part of the equation is activated, the other part (multiplying by 0) cancels out. So, we are left with the log() of our probability which gives us tiny loss values when pᵢ is close to 1 and gets larger and larger the closer our probability gets to the value of 0 (as in us predicting the wrong class), see figure 8 (left) below. In our example we have a probability of 0.95 and therefore end up with a small error value of 0.051 for our observation. If instead, our true value is now 0 instead of 1, then the other part of the loss function activates, and we end up having a large error of 2.966 if we are still predicting that it is churn (=1) with a probability of 0.95, see figure 9 (right) below.</p>
<h2 id="PICTURE">
<a class="anchor" href="#PICTURE" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>PICTURE<a class="anchor-link" href="#PICTURE"> </a>
</h2>
<p>This example is summarised in the first 2 rows of table 1 below. The table, additionally, shows how the loss function behaves in the opposite scenario where the predicted value is 0 with pᵢ=0.01.</p>
<h2 id="TABLE">
<a class="anchor" href="#TABLE" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>TABLE<a class="anchor-link" href="#TABLE"> </a>
</h2>
<p>This example should give you a general idea why BCE works well for tasks where you are predicting either one class or the other. Having such a large error on wrong predictions will force the model to learn a better representation which should minimise the overall error in your model’s prediction performance.</p>
