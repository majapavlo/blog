    <h2>About</h2>
    <p style="font-size: 13">Hello, </p>
    <p style="font-size: 13">I am a Data Scientist based in London. </p>
    <p>My first industry experience in data science was in outlier detection with deep learning.
    I have since been intrigued by neural networks, their capabilites and applications.<p> </p>
    This is my personal blog, where I intend to mostly write about deep learning topics 
    that spark my interest but also other more general machine learning topics.
