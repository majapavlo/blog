    <h2>About me</h2>
    <p style="font-size: 13">
    I am a Data Scientist based in London. </p>
    <p>
    My first industry experience in data science was in outlier detection with deep learning.
    I have since been intrigued by neural networks, their capabilites and applications.
    This is my personal blog, where I mostly intend to write about deep learning that I 
    am curious about but also other machine learningL topics.
