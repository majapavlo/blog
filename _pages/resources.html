    <h2>Some of my favourite resources</h2>
    <p>This space holds select resources that have been my favourite and most helpful learning material.</p>
    <h2>Books</h2>
    <h3 style="padding-left: 40px;">Deep Learning by Andrew Trask</h3>
    <p style="padding-left: 40px;">I find this book one of the most approachable Deep Learning books out there to those who might not have a technical or mathematical background. Andrew goes deeply into details but rather than explaining the mathematics in the classical way he takes a more intuitive approach to explaining how neural nets are built. Love this book for its low barrier to entry. Great if you want to code a neural network from start to finish.</p>
    <h3 style="padding-left: 40px;">Mathematics for Machine Learning by Deisenroth, Faisal &amp; Ong</h3>
    <p style="padding-left: 40px;">This is the only mathematical book I know of that contains all the essential maths basics for machine learning. Could perhaps be perceived as a bit of a dry read, but absolutely great accompanied with the Coursera specialisation: <a href="https://www.coursera.org/specializations/mathematics-machine-learning">Mathematics for Machine Learning</a>. It covers the essential maths if you feel rusty or just want a simple repetition.</p>
    <h3 style="padding-left: 40px;"><a href="https://www.deeplearningbook.org">Deep Learning by Goodfellow, Bengio &amp; Courville </a></h3>
    <p style="padding-left: 40px;">I mostly use this book as a reference to read up on concepts when I need further details and as a learning guide for the basics in deep learning. I think it&rsquo;s a great addition to have when going through any deep learning course or theory.</p>
    <h3 style="padding-left: 40px;">Deep Learning for Coders with fastai and PyTorch by Howard &amp; Gugger</h3>
    <p style="padding-left: 40px;">I am currently still reading through this one (half way at point of writing), but it has already made my list as it is highly practical and there are several ways to read the book. The exercises with notebooks just make it a great learning experience. Similarly to Andrew Trask&rsquo;s book above they aim to make deep learning accessible to a wider audience. Anyone with knowledge in Python should find this book a fun starting point to learn a bit about deep learning. That said a lot of things are high-level, so if you want more maths and depth on theory the Goodfellow one might be better. I will update this one again once I have finished the book.</p>
    <h2>Youtube Channels</h2>
    <p style="padding-left: 40px;">My two favourite channels out there are 3Blue1Brown and StatQuest. They both explain concepts in such an easy and approachable way that you wish you had these resources years back in school.</p>
    <h3 style="padding-left: 40px;"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/3blue1brown">3Blue1Brown</a></h3>
    <p style="padding-left: 40px;">Great for maths refreshers: Grant&rsquo;s essence of linear algebra &amp; calculus series are a dream. Also check out his series on neural networks (great for those who&rsquo;ve never come across them and just want a higher level understanding of how they work).</p>
    <h3 style="padding-left: 40px;"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtYLUTtgS3k1Fg4y5tAhLbw">StatQuest</a></h3>
    <p style="padding-left: 40px;">If only I had known about this channel when I was studying. Josh explains a range of basic machine learning concepts and statistics to an amazingly detailed degree with a lot of great visualisations to help support his explanations.</p>
    <h2>Online Courses</h2>
    <p style="padding-left: 40px;">I have done quite a few online courses ranging across various topics since 2011 but don&rsquo;t consider most of them to have had the same impact on me as going through books. They do, however, provide a great introduction to topics and are much easier to integrate into your daily life than textbooks.</p>
    <h3 style="padding-left: 40px;"><a href="https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning">Deep Learning Specialisation</a></h3>
    <p style="padding-left: 40px;">Andrew Ng&rsquo;s courses on Coursera are infamous by now so I probably don&rsquo;t have to say much about this specialisation. To me personally it provided a great overview on deep learning, it&rsquo;s applications and essential concepts when I first needed to use neural nets in my job. However, back then I did not pay for the course as I was mostly interested in the theory to find a solution for the task I had at work. Years later I decided to give the full course a go and definitely recommend doing the exercises as learning all these concepts helps when later reading papers and trying to implement other concepts yourself.</p>
