    <p><strong>Some of my favourite resources</strong></p>
    <p>List of select sources that have been my favourite and most helpful learning material</p>
    <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
    <p><strong>Deep Learning Andrew Trask</strong></p>
    <p>Most approachable Deep Learning book out there if you have no engineering or mathematical background. Goes into deeply into details but rather than explaining the maths Trask takes a more intuitive approach to explaining how neural nets are built. Great if you want to code a neural network from start to finish.</p>
    <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
    <p><strong>Maths for Machine Learning</strong></p>
    <p>Great accompanied while doing the Imperial Online Course on Coursera. Essential basics if you&rsquo;re rusty on your maths or just want a simple repetition.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><strong>Deep Learning for Coders with fastai and PyTorch</strong></p>
    <p>Currently going through this one.</p>
    <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
    <p><strong>Machine Learning Introductory Book</strong></p>
    <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
    <p><strong><a href="https://www.deeplearningbook.org/">Deep Learning Bible</a></strong></p>
    <p>Mostly use it as a reference to read up on concepts</p>
    <p><strong><br />Econometrics Wooldrige</strong></p>
