    "## Informal Definition\n",
    "The log-normal distribution is a right skewed continuous probability distribution, meaning it has a long tail towards the right. It is used for modelling various natural phenomena such as income distributions, the length of chess games or the time to repair a maintainable system and more.\n",

    "μ is the location parameter and σ the [scale parameter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scale_parameter) of the distribution. _Caution here!_ These two parameters should not be mistaken for the more familiar mean or standard deviation from a normal distribution. When our log-normal data is transformed using logarithms our **μ** can then be viewed as the mean _(of the transformed data)_ and **σ** as the standard deviation _(of the transformed data)_. But without these transformations μ and σ here are simply two parameters that define our log-normal, not the mean or standard deviation!"

If you then take the logarithm of all your data points, the newly transformed points will now fit a normal distribution. This simply means that when you take the log of your log-normal data you end up with a normal distribution. See figure below.\n",
