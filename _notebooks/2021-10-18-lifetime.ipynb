    "\n",
    "Customer lifetime value (CLV or CLTV) is a widely used marketing metric that informs operational and strategic marketing decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Early/initial research efforts stem from direct marketing looking to find approaches for estimating lifetime value (LTV) to help with marketing decision making [1]. It has meanwhile been widely adopted across various business functions/domains/segments and therefore has slightly different definitions/interpretations/ways of calculation depending on the context and use of the metric. Customer lifetime value can be broadly viewed as the revenue that a business will derive from the entire relationship with a customer [2]. Having accurate insights into customers future purchase behaviour can support a variety of business activities such as product development or customer retention. It can also help companies optimise their customer acquisition costs and help with budgeting and allocation of their marketing spend. Another important way in which CLV can be used to support decision making is to segment customers according to their CLV and then personalise marketing activities according to the different segments [3]. This way a company can target specific customer segments with different offers and loyalty schemes thereby spend their resources more cost-efficiently.\n",

    "Don't want to delve too deep into lifetime value. The main objective of this post is to explain what Xiaojing Wang, Tianqi Liu and Jingang Miao did in their paper.\n",
