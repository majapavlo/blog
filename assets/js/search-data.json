            "content": "About . Predicting a customer’s lifetime value (LTV) can be quite a challenging task. Wang, Liu and Miao propose using a neural network with a mixture loss to handle the intricacies of churn and lifetime value modelling of new customers. . In this blogpost we’ll take a look at their proposed solution and go through the reasoning behind their ideas. The first section briefly summarises the importance and challenges of lifetime value modelling. It also looks at how Wang, Liu and Miao tackle these problems and quickly runs through the results of their paper. The second section then takes a deeper look at their chosen architecture, specifically the output layer. Lastly, the final section goes through the proposed loss function in more detail. . This post is not intended to be an in-depth mathematical explanation; but rather, is meant to provide a high-level, more approachable explanation of the paper. .",

            "content": "Example Markdown Post . Basic setup . Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format: . YEAR-MONTH-DAY-filename.md . Where YEAR is a four-digit number, MONTH and DAY are both two-digit numbers, and filename is whatever file name you choose, to remind yourself what this post is about. .md is the file extension for markdown files. . The first line of the file should start with a single hash character, then a space, then your title. This is how you create a “level 1 heading” in markdown. Then you can create level 2, 3, etc headings as you wish but repeating the hash character, such as you see in the line ## File names above. . Basic formatting . You can use italics, bold, code font text, and create links. Here’s a footnote 1. Here’s a horizontal rule: . . Lists . Here’s a list: . item 1 | item 2 | . And a numbered list: . item 1 | item 2 | Boxes and stuff . This is a quotation . . You can include alert boxes …and… . . You can include info boxes Images . . Code . You can format text and code per usual . General preformatted text: . # Do a thing do_thing() . Python code and output: . # Prints &#39;2&#39; print(1+1) . 2 .
